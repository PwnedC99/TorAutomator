# TorAutomator Mac

A little Programm I wrote to save some hassle installing Tor on Mac

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

Required Stuff you need for this Tool?

```
None :)
```

### Installing

1. Step
First, start the Tool and select the third option to install Tor, Homebrew and setting it all up. You can choose by typing in the number of the option you want and pressing enter.

```
[3] Install the Tor Network
```
2. Step
The Tool will do the whole work for you. Once its done make sure to restart the tool, run the 3 option again to make sure everything is set up.

## Connecting to Tor

1. Step
A second Terminal Window will appear which can be minimized but needs to stay open. On the main Terminal Window you need to now select your Network Card by entering the name and pressing Enter.
You can choose between Ethernet or Wi-Fi

```
[1] Connect to the Tor Network
```
2. Step
A second Terminal Window will appear which can be minimized but needs to stay open. On the main Terminal Window you need to now select your Network Card by entering the name and pressing Enter.
You can choose between Ethernet or Wi-Fi

```
Please Select your Adapter (Wi-Fi Default)
>> Wi-Fi
```

## Disconnecting from Tor

1. Step
Disconneting is as simple as connecting. You simply re run the Tool and hit the 2nd option this time.

```
[2] Disconnect from the Tor Network
```
2. Step
The same frame with choosing the Network Adapter will appear again. Just redo the steps made above to connect and you will be disconnected from Tor.

```
Please Select your Adapter (Wi-Fi Default)

```

## Deployment

This only works for Mac at the moment. Support for other devices isn't planed.

## Known Issues

Hitting enter for default when choosing the Network Adapter doesen't work yet. Fixing soon.
